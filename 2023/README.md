# Advent of Code 2023

Python files read from `stdin` and can be run like this:

```sh
python part_one.py < input.dat
```

Solutions written in Haskell, Bourne Shell and other languages might have a different method of receiving a file – typically as an argument or through `stdin`.

## Scoreboard

✔ : Finished on time  
🆗 : Finished, but a little late  
⭐ : Free star

Delta: Time between finishing part 1 and 2  
Late: The day I finished the task, if it wasn't the day the task was given  
Time: Execution time, measured with `time`

Languages: Python (🐍), Haskell (λ), C++ (➕), Bourne Shell (🐚)
